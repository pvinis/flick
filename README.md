flick

use .flickrc for something like "light" or "dark".

add extensions and ways to use flick with vim, vscode, macos etc


make a simple command that installs with brew, that i can say flick, and it will switch between dark and light, or flick on flick off for light and dark respectively.


later, add time based flick that runs in the background and flicks automatically
